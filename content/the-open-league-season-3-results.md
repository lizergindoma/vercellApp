So folks, that was Season 3 of The Open League. Quite the ride, huh? There have been some big developments, and TON has gone from success to success. It’s all been happening quickly, and we know you’re probably a little tired from keeping up with everything—Notcoin, new announcements, and the entire ever-growing ecosystem. So, after we’re done celebrating the Season 3 results, we’ll give you a two-week break to gather your strength before starting up again with something extra special.

During this break, make sure to get ready for Season 4; there’s going to be a lot happening! We’ll update you on any rule changes—some will be pretty wild! Keep in mind that for the next two weeks, there will be no LP boosts until the start of the next season; teams can provide their own, and TON Society will happily advertise them. Season 4 will start at 11:00 UTC on June 12 and will last two weeks.

Make sure you subscribe to The Open League Telegram channel to stay up to date with everything.
