The introduction of the W5 wallet standard in Tonkeeper Pro brings a host of benefits that enhance both the user and merchant experience. W5 supports gasless transactions, delegation and account recovery, subscription payments with tokens and Toncoin, and cheap multi-transfers.

Users will have access to 25% lower blockchain fees, a new flexible plugin interface for developers, and internal message signing that allows delegation of gas fee payments.

2.  Enable the W5 feature in the Dev Menu.
3.  Switch your active address to W5 under wallet settings.

**Battery features:**
