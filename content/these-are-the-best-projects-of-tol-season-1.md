What’s cooking, you absolute Chads? The Open League Season 1 is officially over, and it’s time to look back at the best projects of the past month. The last month was hectic, filled with announcements flooding (pun intended) from Dubai’s Token 2049 – from USDt and XAUt on TON to Telegram’s plans to reward sticker creators and more. While the market went through significant ups and downs and influencers kept fighting over whether we were in a bear market or a bull market, one thing remained unchanged: the growth happening in The Open League.

In Season 1, we welcomed several major changes that rewrote the rules of The Open League and allowed more projects to participate for rewards. We introduced new leaderboards, launched Memelandia and DeFi Grants, and boosted the rewards for top projects. In addition, we airdropped rewards to the most active traders and distributed multiple rewards.

In addition, the two leading TON DEXs, Ston.fi and DeDust, have now deployed new boosts. The total farming rewards to be distributed to the participants of the Major League are $224,483 on Ston.fi and $66,304 on DeDust.

But now, let’s get to the main point of this article.

**Conclusion**


------------------

As always, we’re extremely grateful to all projects that participated in last month’s season and are excited to see what’s coming in Season 2, which kicked off on May 1st.

Season 2 will bring a few changes that will affect the progression of The Open League. These changes are mainly focused on making the league more dynamic, faster, and simpler to understand.

*   **Season 2 will last only 2 weeks** instead of the previous 1 month. This will speed up reward distribution and allow more projects to participate in the upcoming seasons.
*   **We’re reducing the number of leaderboards from five to three: App Battle, Token Major League & Token Minor League.** Meme Coin category will be merged under token league, DeFi and Liquid Staking categories are removed.
*   **Major League promotions:** JVT, ANON, WEB3, REDO, @BTC25
*   **New Minor League teams:** DYOR, OPEN, BURN, DICK, CRYPTON, and WALL
*   **New App Battle teams:** Shardify, XPLUS, Cheques Corp, Catizen, and The Pixels
