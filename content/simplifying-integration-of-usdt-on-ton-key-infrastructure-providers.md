With our goal of putting crypto in every pocket, supporting and encouraging the integration of USDt on TON is one of our key ways to achieve this. We're simplifying the integration of USDt on TON into crypto exchanges, onramps, payment services, and more as a significant step towards expanding the utility and accessibility of digital assets. To facilitate this seamless integration, several infrastructure providers play pivotal roles in ensuring the efficiency and security of transactions.

But first, you need to know that USDt on TON runs as a Jetton.

In summary, Jettons represents tokenized assets that leverage the capabilities of the TON Blockchain for secure and efficient transactions.

The most relevant infrastructure providers have already integrated the Jetton standard, and here is a spotlight on the essential providers.

### 

**MPC Wallet Providers**

Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallet providers are crucial for securing digital assets while maintaining accessibility. These providers utilize advanced cryptographic techniques to distribute private keys among multiple parties, enhancing security without sacrificing usability. For exchanges integrating USDt-TON, MPC wallet solutions ensure robust protection against potential threats while enabling efficient management of digital assets.

*   **Dfns:** Dfns is a leading wallets-as-a-service platform known for its robust MPC security and reliable blockchain integrations, featuring clients such as Zodia Custody, Fidelity, ABN AMRO, Bridge, and many others. More recently, they have started enabling exchanges to deal with USDt on TON transactions. They are the first MPC wallet infrastructure to offer data indexing on the TON Blockchain, jetton broadcasting, balance tracking, token management, transfer history, and webhooks with TON.

### 

**Custodians**

Custodians play a vital role in the storage and management of digital assets on behalf of their clients. They offer secure storage solutions, often employing advanced security protocols such as cold storage and multi-signature wallets. For USDt-TON integration, custodians ensure that exchanges can securely hold and manage large volumes of digital assets, providing peace of mind to traders and investors alike.

*   **Cobo:** Cobo is a trusted custody and wallet infrastructure provider that simplifies digital asset security. As the industry's only unified platform integrating Custodial, MPC, Smart Contract, and Exchange Wallets, Cobo offers advanced risk controls and developer tools that lay the foundations for any blockchain innovation and support over 3,000 tokens, including USDt on TON.

*   **PrimeVault:** PrimeVault's platform allows enterprise users to conduct and automate virtually any on-chain operation at scale while ensuring the security of digital assets, including Toncoin, USDt on TON, and any Jetton standard on TON blockchain.
*   **Copper:** With a reputation for secure custodial services, Copper offers comprehensive insurance and compliance measures to ensure the safekeeping of digital assets, including USDt-TON.

### 

**RPC Solutions**

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) solutions enable communication between software systems, facilitating seamless interaction with blockchain networks like TON. RPC providers offer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that exchanges can integrate into their systems, enabling functionalities such as transaction monitoring, balance inquiries, and smart contract interactions. These solutions are essential for the real-time integration and operation of USDt-TON on crypto exchanges.

*   **TONX API:** Provides customized quotas for high-load users accessing RPCs. Focused on the TON blockchain and the Asian market, they offer better customer support and reliable service based on past experience with [TonStake.com](https://TonStake.com) and [TonKey.app](https://TonKey.app).
*   **NOWNodes:** Provides access to shared and dedicated blockchain nodes via fast API with a load balancer. It supports 100+ protocols and networks and offers unlimited availability to TON nodes and indexers with no rate limits and 99.95% uptime.
*   \*\* GetBlock:\*\* GetBlock is an RPC node provider and Web3 infrastructure platform. It fuels dApps of all types with reliable connections to full and archive nodes of 50+ blockchains, including all mainstream L1s and L2s, via JSON RPC, gRPC, and WebSockets interfaces. GetBlock was the first major RPC node provider to add support for TON, removing the need for TON-centric apps' teams to run full nodes themselves. GetBlock offers a 30% discount on your first subscription to any shared node package: one month, six months, or even a full year!

**The Importance of Collaboration**


---------------------------------------

The successful integration of USDt on TON into crypto exchanges relies heavily on collaboration among these infrastructure providers. By leveraging their expertise in the blockchain space, crypto exchanges, onramps, and payment services can ensure a seamless user experience while maintaining the highest security and efficiency standards.

As the demand for diverse digital assets grows, these infrastructure providers continue to innovate, paving the way for broader adoption and integration across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Their efforts not only support the operational needs of key platforms in the Web3 industry but also contribute to the overall growth and stability of the digital asset market.
