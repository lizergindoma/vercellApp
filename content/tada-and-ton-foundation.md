At TON, our goal is to make Web3 accessible to everyone. That's why the TON (The Open Network) Foundation has partnered with TADA, a leading ride-hailing platform in Southeast Asia. Together, we’ve introduced TADA mini, a Telegram-based service that combines ride-hailing with the simplicity of Web3 technology. This partnership brings the real-world utility of digital assets to everyday services, like booking a ride.

What the partnership means


------------------------------

With TADA Mini, users can hail a ride directly through Telegram without downloading a separate app or going through long sign-up processes. Users can also pay for rides using TON or USDT-TON, putting their digital assets to practical use. This service is ideal for anyone who values convenience and enjoys the benefits of Web3 technology.

To celebrate the TADA partnership, TADA and TON will offer 4,000 free rides during TOKEN2049, a leading crypto event in Singapore. Users who take advantage of TADA Mini during this event will experience a new way to book rides and access exclusive discounts. TADA’s existing presence in Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia makes it an ideal partner for expanding Web3 technology in the region. And with plans to expand into Hong Kong, TADA is on a path to becoming a more influential company in the global ride-hailing market.

The first 4,000 users to hail a ride using the mini app in Singapore during TOKEN2049 will get their ride for free. After the 4,000 free journeys have been claimed, users will receive a 50% discount on their fare for TON Trip via the TADA mini app (terms and conditions apply).

Harvey Kim, Head of Korea at TON Foundation stated on the partnership:

> “If we want to accelerate the successful adoption of Web3 solutions, it’s crucial that strong partnerships are forged with exciting Web2 platforms that enable their users to quickly become familiar with the many benefits of Web3. This partnership is a key milestone for us, as we look to continue TON blockchain’s growth across Southeast Asia. I can’t wait to take my first journey next week!”

A key step for Web3 growth


------------------------------

Partnerships like this will encourage more people to adopt Web3 solutions. By integrating blockchain technology into daily services like ride-hailing, we’re helping users experience the benefits of digital assets without understanding the complexities of Web3. The partnership with TADA is just the beginning, and we’re excited to bring more practical uses of TON to our global community. Our community can expect more collaborations in the future to expand the Web3 ecosystem.
