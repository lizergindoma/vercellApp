At the end of last year, we announced that Animoca Brands, a leading Web3 gaming and metaverse company, became TON’s largest validator. We knew this was the beginning of something great, but we couldn’t have predicted the consequences of this step, which are now visible across the entire TON Ecosystem.

Since then, Animoca Brands, with its portfolio of over 450 companies, embraced the TON infrastructure and the amazing TON Community and dedicated significant energy, time, and resources to boost TON’s adoption and highlight its potential as the go-to infrastructure for GameFi and Web3 gaming. Now, half a year later, this partnership is progressing to the next level as we team up with Animoca Brands' Mocaverse and MOCA Foundation to drive cross-ecosystem growth and establish TON as a premier platform for content, gaming, and community.

**TON x Animoca Brands x MOCA**


-----------------------------------

TON Foundation, Mocaverse, and MOCA Foundation agreed to create a $20M MOCA Coin and Toncoin reserve, which will be used to incentivize developer and user adoption of the TON ecosystem through joint incentives like The Open League, hackathons, and accelerator programs. The funds will leverage our combined ecosystems and incentivize cross-functional development aimed at boosting development and user activity.

TON Foundation and MOCA Foundation will utilize go-to-market and token resources to facilitate user cross-pollination across the foundations’ respective ecosystems. With this partnership, Animoca Brands and Mocaverse will actively promote the benefits of launching and integrating with the TON blockchain for their partners developing gaming projects.

> "TON's vision of freedom of interaction aligns strategically with Animoca Brands' focus on digital property rights,” **said Steve Yun, TON Foundation council President.** “This partnership validates that TON has become the platform of choice for games and social apps. The reputation system we co-create will become a powerful opt-in platform through which users can express their identity and values on-chain. We are excited to take a leap with Animoca Brands towards widespread adoption of blockchain applications."

**TON Society ID**


----------------------

TON Society ID will be a decentralized identity credential that allows 500 million TON users by 2028 to use governance power based on the TON blockchain. It will enable the community to build a true and meaningful digital identity through a reputation system within the TON Society's new community governance framework. Governance will not only involve voting on proposals but also finding consensus through open debate, and participation in the TON Society ID is entirely opt-in and 100% the user's choice. The TON Society ID system will be a mutually beneficial program for founders to identify active users and for users to gain value by generating content related to their favorite applications.

Mocaverse is the marquee consumer network with an interoperable infrastructure layer of Account, Identity, Reputation, and PointFi systems seeded by Animoca Brands. Under this partnership, Mocaverse will support the development of a reputation scoring system on TON and will contribute to the TON Society ID by sharing data from their gaming and content systems, as well as providing tech support.

At the epicenter of the Animoca Brands ecosystem, Mocaverse owns the Web3 identity and PointFi system, where Moca NFT holders and Moca ID users can seamlessly navigate and engage across and beyond 400+ rewarding experiences from Animoca Brands’ investment portfolio with on-chain proof of reputation. With the integration of the Moca ID, TON Society ID will benefit from the rich on-chain content and community.

> “The collaboration between Mocaverse, TON Foundation, and MOCA Foundation is an exciting milestone on our shared mission of Web3 mass adoption and the advancement of digital property rights,” **Yat Siu, Executive Chairman and co-founder of Animoca Brands.** “The unique partnership between Telegram and the TON Foundation and the collaboration revealed today provide an opportunity to bring Moca ID and the Realm Network SDK to Telegram’s 900 million users, which we believe could exponentially magnify all our respective network effects.”

Through mutual development, each ecosystem will receive an injection of new tools and users, as well as funds, furthering our mutual goal of large-scale Web3 user adoption. Animoca Brands, their portfolio companies, and Moca Network will provide the consumer layer of content focused on culture and entertainment to the TON Ecosystem, the Web3 infrastructure of Telegram, with over 900 million active users.
