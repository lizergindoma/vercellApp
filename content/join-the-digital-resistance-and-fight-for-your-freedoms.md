We are at a tipping point. Governments, corporations, and political correctness are tightening their grip on our most fundamental human rights: freedom of speech and digital privacy. Our lives—our memories, our messages, our data—are all online, vulnerable to surveillance and censorship. The threat is real, and it’s growing every day.

Pavel Durov’s arrest in France reignited the fire of #DigitalResistance. Durov has stood as a symbol of the guardian of people’s privacy for years. Today, it’s our turn to carry the torch.

**Free speech is under attack globally**


-----------------------------------

In recent weeks, free speech has come under attack. Elon Musk was threatened by an EU politician for hosting a live interview with a presidential candidate, citing concerns it would interfere with the US election. In the UK, the government reacted to riots surrounding immigration by threatening and even jailing citizens for their online posts. A clip of a vice presidential candidate surfaced, shockingly declaring that “Free speech is not guaranteed.”

These events are not isolated—they are part of a broader, coordinated effort to silence free speech and freedom of expression. Just today, Mark Zuckerberg admitted to censoring across Meta platforms at the behest of the US Government. Now, with Pavel Durov detained, reportedly under the pretense of lack of moderation, the situation has reached a critical point. Even the CEO of Rumble, a platform dedicated to free expression, reportedly faced threats from governments, forcing him to flee Europe for his safety.

This is more than just a series of incidents. This is an assault on the fundamental rights that uphold our societies. We must act now.

**The Birth of Resistance Dog**

In 2018, the government tried to censor Telegram, a messaging app that became a bastion of privacy and free speech. They demanded encryption keys, wanting to spy on millions of users. Pavel Durov, Telegram’s founder, refused to comply. The government responded by blocking over 18 million IP addresses, causing chaos across the internet. But Durov didn’t back down. Instead, he launched the #DigitalResistance—a global movement to fight censorship and defend digital privacy.

The symbol of this movement is the dog in the hood: the Resistance Dog. In 2011, Pavel Durov was ordered to eradicate the posts of liberal thinkers and dissidents. In response, Pavel posted a picture of his dog, refusing to silence anyone on his platform. Since then, this dog has become the mascot of free speech. It has become an emblem of hope, incredible strength, and courage.

**Resistance in Action**

The government attack on Telegram wasn’t just an assault on an app—it was an assault on freedom. But the people fought back. Durov called for a peaceful protest, urging the supporters of free internet to fly paper planes from their windows. This simple act of defiance caught fire. The planes became another symbol of resistance, a reminder that the people would not be silenced.

The movement spread. On April 30, 2018, thousands of advocates took to the streets, standing up for their right to communicate freely. The Resistance Dog was everywhere. Despite continued efforts to block Telegram, the community found ways to keep the app alive, and the government’s two-year ban crumbled, proving that the people's will could not be broken.

### 

**The Urgent Call to Action**

Fast-forward to August 24, 2024. Pavel Durov is detained in France under mysterious circumstances. Outrage erupts across the globe. The Telegram and TON communities rally behind him, changing their profile pictures to the Resistance Dog and flooding social media with the hashtag #FreeDurov, forcing the response of French President Emmanuel Macron himself.

This symbolic change goes deeper than solidarity. Memes are powerful representations of culture, a shortcut to an emotional feeling. TON Community and Toncoin’s culture, seen through Resistance Dog as the #DigitalResistance sends a powerful message: we stand united in protecting fundamental rights—**the right to privacy and the freedom to speak our minds.**

This gesture is not just about showing support—it’s an act of resistance. It’s a declaration that the values of the #DigitalResistance are non-negotiable, and we will not compromise.

This is more than just a battle for one man’s freedom. It’s a battle for our future. Freedom of speech and the right to privacy are not negotiable—they are the foundation of society. If we allow anyone to strip these rights away, we risk losing everything.
