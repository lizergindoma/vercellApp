We all wonder about the future—what it will look like, what will change, and how it will impact our lives. Wonder no more. The future is here, and it's powered by blockchain. With over one hundred planned integrations with various local partners, TON Foundation and Tether are on a mission to make USDt on TON accessible to everyone, everywhere.

In this discussion, we introduce you to our ambitious plans to put USDt-TON in every pocket. These plans promise to revolutionize how we interact with crypto. Let’s dive into the details and what they mean for you and the rest of TON’s growing global community.

The Power Behind Our Initiative


-----------------------------------

As a result of this latest initiative, our efforts towards TON mass adoption are stronger than ever. We are working to communicate and facilitate seamless USDt integrations on TON with local partners and communities worldwide.

TON Foundation is ensuring each integration aligns with the ecosystem's goal of providing global access to USDt on TON. With local partners, we are launching integrations that let anyone acquire USDt on TON and enter the TON Ecosystem in minutes. Additionally, we are collaborating with partners to enable USDt payments for goods and services.

So far, we’ve completed integrations with local payment gateways and processors in Africa, Southeast Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America, and more are on the way.

Over the upcoming weeks and months, we will team up with on/off ramps and global and local exchanges to provide more options to access and trade Toncoin and USDt on TON.

How To Get Involved
