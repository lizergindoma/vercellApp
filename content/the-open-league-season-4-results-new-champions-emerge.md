**The Open League: Season 5**


---------------------------------

**Season 5 kicks off on July 10 at 11 am UTC!** Applications are open now and close on July 3 at 11 am UTC. Details on the prize pool, LP boost size, duration, and methodology are coming soon. Stay tuned; it's going to be epic!

The top 10 projects from the Token Battle are in for a significant opportunity! They can snatch an LP boost for their liquidity providers in Season 5, but they need to meet the usual benchmarks:

*   be ready to match the boost with your own token
*   have an active token mining mechanism
*   maintain a TVL of $200k+ in pairs with TON, stablecoins, and staked TON

Keep an eye out, as meeting these criteria could supercharge your project's growth in the next season!
