Another week, another exciting partnership. This time, we’ve teamed up with [Cocos Studio](https://www.cocos.com/en), aiming to revolutionize the Web3 mini-games landscape. This partnership will leverage CocosStudio's advanced game development tools and TON's ecosystem to kick off a new era in digital entertainment. From today, Cocos SDK will integrate with TON Blockchain, empowering its global user base of Web2 mini-app developers to experience the benefits of building and deploying decentralized mini-apps.

TON’s ecosystem has seen exponential growth across all sectors this year, with the blockchain's Total Value Locked (TVL) surpassing $750 million by 31st July 2024. Mini-Apps have been key in this expansion, with projects like Notcoin accumulating over 30 million users and Hamster Kombat recently celebrating 300 million users. The partnership between TON Foundation and Cocos Studio will enable developers to capitalize on the TON ecosystem's rise by creating easily monetizable dApps. As a powerful distribution channel, these dApps can leverage Telegram with its 950 million monthly active users.

> "Partnering with TON represents a monumental step in advancing Web3 game development,” **said Luna, CMO of Cocos Studio.** “We share the same values and long-term goals as TON: serving developers to achieve mass adoption, upgrading the industry, and reducing costs. Together, we are setting new standards and creating vast opportunities for developers worldwide."

Integrating [Cocos Studio](https://www.cocos.com/en) with TON will offer support for game developers creating innovative, high-quality mini-games. This collaboration will enhance the TON Ecosystem with in-house games from Cocos Studio and provide valuable resources to developers, projects, creators, and studios looking to contribute. By utilizing the Web2 expertise of mini-game developers, this initiative seeks to introduce more expertise, attract more players, and deliver immersive gameplay experiences to the Web3.

> “I firmly believe that the future of gaming will be on-chain, enabling a new paradigm in which everyone can focus on creating value rather than extracting it,” **said Inal Kardan, Gaming Lead at TON Foundation.** “This new partnership with Cocos Studio will seamlessly bring tens of thousands of mini-game developers from Web2 to Web3. By building TON-based mini-apps using Telegram’s Mini App platform, developers can reach a massive audience of engaged gamers. We’re delighted to be working with Cocos Studio to accelerate our mission of putting crypto in every pocket by building a Web3 ecosystem in Telegram.”

In the future, Cocos Engine will roll out new features that enable One-Click Game Development for the TON ecosystem, continually expanding the possibilities in Web3 gaming. This will streamline the development process, making it easier for developers to create games within the TON ecosystem.
