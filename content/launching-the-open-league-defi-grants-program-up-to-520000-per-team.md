The TradiFi world is not paying enough attention to the incredible innovations happening in DeFi at the moment; TON, however, is. We are extremely proud to announce [The Open League DeFi Grants Program](https://ton.org/open-league?filterBy=defi), a new initiative aimed at backing the outstanding efforts of Web3 builders in DeFi and dApps. TON is leading the way in embracing the most significant DeFi trends in the industry, and we invite Web3 DeFi builders to build their solutions with us.

By building a [Telegram Mini App (TMA)](https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/telegram-apps) for your project, you can access over 900M monthly active Telegram users and go directly to your target audience instead of waiting for them to come to you.

With TMA, you can create a simple onboarding flow with a smooth user experience and invite your users to experience DeFi directly on their favorite messenger.

**TON is the new home of DeFi**


-----------------------------------

TON Foundation launched [The Open League](https://ton.org/en/open-league) to help onboard Telegram users to Web3 and support ecosystem projects in sustaining and growing their audiences. Now, these opportunities are expanding to DeFi. With up to $300,000 in user incentives and up to $200,000 in grants per team, we are setting the stage for DeFi projects to not only launch but also excel and expand on TON. The most successful teams can receive up to $520,000 in grants!
