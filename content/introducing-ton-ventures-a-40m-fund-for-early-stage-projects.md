The TON ecosystem is on the brink of a new chapter. Today, we’re excited to announce the launch of [TON Ventures](https://tonventures.io/), a venture capital organization born out of the expertise and vision of former senior team members from the TON Foundation, Ian W. and Inal K. Backed by a $40M fund, TON Ventures is set to fuel the next wave of innovation in the TON ecosystem by supporting early-stage crypto projects.

The driving force behind TON Ventures is a team of early TON Foundation members and experienced builders. Leading this initiative are Ian W., the former Director of TON Accelerator, and Inal K., the former Gaming Lead at TON Foundation. Their past collaboration has led to the success of TON Web3 games like Catizen and Gatto and the perpetual exchange Tradoor.

At its core, [TON Ventures](https://tonventures.io/) is about more than just funding—it's about building the future. They focus on consumer applications that harness the power of Telegram’s social features and Telegram Mini Apps (TMAs). Their goal is to empower founders with the tools and infrastructure required to create applications with the potential for mass adoption and long-term sustainability. In addition to financial backing, the selected projects will benefit from the team's extensive experience, global network, and hands-on support. To boost the projects and help them succeed, TON Ventures will leverage Telegram Ads and provide access to exclusive growth experiments within TON.

> “TON and Telegram have created a paradigm shift for web3. With our deep experience in the ecosystem, we believe the highest leverage point is in capital allocation for TON. Now, we have the exciting opportunity to share our insights and strategies for thriving in the unique design space created by TON and Telegram, empowering a new generation of innovators and builders. By connecting visionary investors with cutting-edge projects, we aim to accelerate the growth of the TON ecosystem and foster groundbreaking advancements in decentralized technology,” **said Ian W., Managing Director of TON Ventures**.

This exciting development comes at a time when the TON ecosystem is experiencing explosive growth. In recent months, [TON has surpassed Ethereum in daily active users](https://x.com/Delphi_Digital/status/1800199716367397300), with [total assets in use on the platform soaring to $1.14 billion in July](https://defillama.com/chain/TON)—up from $71 million at the start of the year.

The rise of tap-to-earn gaming in 2024 has also played a significant role in this growth, drawing hundreds of millions of new users into the Web3 gaming space. A prime example is the meteoric rise of Notcoin, a game that captured the attention of 35 million players in just three months, distributing over 90% of its token supply to its dedicated community.

As we move forward, TON Ventures is poised to be a catalyst for the continued expansion and success of the TON ecosystem. By bringing together visionary investors and groundbreaking projects, they’re not just investing in technology—they’re investing in the future of decentralized innovation.
