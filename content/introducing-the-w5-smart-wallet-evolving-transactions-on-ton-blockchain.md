We all know that feeling when you get a FOMO, and you need to make a quick swap or have a need to make a fast transaction just to realize that your assets are stuck in your wallet as you don't have enough native tokens to pay for the gas fee. It's such a headacheâ€“you can't move your assets, and the only way to resolve the issue is to deposit more assets from another wallet or an exchange.

The Tonkeeper team and the TON Core team of developers working on The Open Network decided to end this obsolete mechanism that hurts the user experience of Web3 and implemented a new solution that is a game-changer to how we interact with the blockchain.

**Introducing the W5 Smart Wallet**


---------------------------------------

We're excited to announce the launch of the W5 Smart Wallet, a groundbreaking development enabling gasless transactions. The W5 wallet introduces a new feature, the so-called gasless transaction. Users can now use USDt for gas fees when sending USDt and Notcoin for gas fees when sending Notcoin. This means you no longer need to hold Toncoin to make transactions, significantly lowering the entry barriers to using the TON Blockchain.

**The W5 wallet is now live on Tonkeeper and will soon be available on TON Space and MyTonWallet.** Other TON-based wallets are expected to adopt this innovation in the coming months.

> "The W5 Smart Wallet has pushed the boundaries of what's possible on TON blockchain," **said Oleg Andreev, CEO at Tonkeeper.** "Our collaboration with TON Core ensures that users experience unparalleled security, efficiency, and ease of use. This simplicity holds the key to bringing blockchain technology to a mainstream audience and putting crypto in every pocket."

This milestone showcases the TON Community's commitment to making crypto accessible and user-friendly. With over 5.8 million monthly active on-chain wallets, TON's growing Web3 ecosystem can now offer an efficient, headache-free payment experience, combining the ease of Web2 with the benefits of Web3.

### 

**Parallel Processing for Better and Faster Batch Transactions**

The W5 smart wallet also offers advanced parallel processing capabilities, allowing you to execute up to 255 transactions simultaneously. Imagine using blockchain to pay subscriptions, or setting up robust security features like two-factor authentication, wallet freezing, and key recovery all at once. This enhanced functionality makes the user experience smoother and more efficient.

> **Anatoliy Makosov, Technical Lead at TON Core, added**, "TON's almost limitlessly scalable architecture, backed by Telegram's unparalleled power as a distribution channel, has the potential to create a paradigm shift for payments. The W5 Smart Wallet is the latest step in this journey, bringing industry-leading affordability, speed, and simplicity to TON."

With W5 Smart Wallet, we're not just inventing new ways of interacting with the blockchain; we're fixing the issues that have pained the community since blockchain first came into existence. This is yet another step on our journey towards putting crypto in every pocket and enabling mass adoption of Web3 through building easy-to-use and affordable solutions.

We want to encourage other TON wallet service providers to embrace this solution and integrate it into their wallets as a top priority to ensure that everyone on TON can enjoy the latest benefits and have the same seamless user experience.
